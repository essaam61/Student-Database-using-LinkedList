# Student-Database-using-LinkedList
Created a simple student management system/database module using linked list in C programming language. The system should contain the following items: Id and year of student, the Ids of three courses in which the student is enrolled and their grades.

The student management system could perform the following operations:

-Add, delete and read a student entry. (Up to 10 entries max)

-Check if the database is full.

-Get the size of students currently in the database.

-Get the list of IDs of students in the database.

-Check if a provided student ID exists.
